# React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

## Code Splitting, Analyzing Bundle Size, Progressive Web App, Advanced Configuration, and Troubleshooting

These sections have moved. Refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs) for more details.

## Ejecting

Note: `npm run eject` is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back.

It removes the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. After ejecting, you have full control over them.
